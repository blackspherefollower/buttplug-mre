# Buttplug Forwarder Classes

These classes are brorrowed with some minor modification from qdot's [simple-teledildonics-app](https://github.com/qdot/simple-teledildonics-app/blob/master/src/server.ts).

We don't require the authentication piece that the teledildonics app does: we're only really doing one way communication here.

Not everything here is required right now, but will likley be as the project matures (the StatusEmmiter and connection flags for example).
